We were called in by FOX Sports LA to work on a new kind of 3D -emotional- shorts, something they had never tried before. Of course, we loved the challenge. I had the opportuniy to work as a producer for this piece, and was ultimately responsible for it.

This more-than-50-shots-spot was a CRAZY ride, as it was delivered and done from start to finish in less than two months. Our first approach was to do a completely 3D project, as we usually did, but considering how tight our resources were we had to efficiently manage our time and mix different techniques to get the job DONE!
