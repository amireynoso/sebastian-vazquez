DU called us to work on an online short that would promote a new campaign aimed at young kids to have the opportunity to play a football game with their favourite stars. Who would ever refuse that? With the help of many very talented artists, we worked on great character designs, and delivered an awesome product.

This was undoubtedly my biggest personal challenge at Peppermelon, as I was responsible for all aspects of production after pre-production. The scale of the project was very big and during 3-4 months we worked very hard on it, having over 30+ characters, twelve scenarios, more than five distinct vehicles, lots of wardrobes and FX, like crowd simulations!
