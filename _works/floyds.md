Great news! Floyd's Sticker Squad won 3rd place on Google Indie Latam contest! YAY!

FSQ is an action mobile game featuring time travelling mechanics and really awesome holographic stickers. Neat, huh? A casual shoot-em up where you get to replay each level with your past-self, making yourself more and more powerful every time! Death is a Strategy... More replays means more bullets, and in a SHOOT-EM-UP, more bullets, is kind of a good thing. 

I worked as a technical production coordinator on it, and was ultimately responsible for coordinating many aspects of it, but mainly the whole holographic development for the stickers, packets and boxes (store), the tutorial and 3D implementations. I also worked on animations, many UI screens, the low-res adaptation workflow, amongst other tasks.
