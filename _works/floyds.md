Google Indie Latam 3rd place winner.

Action mobile game featuring time travelling mechanics and stickers. 

Awesome! I worked as a technical production coordinator on it, and was ultimately responsible for many aspects of it, but mainly the whole holographic work for the stickers, lots of UI screens, packets and boxes (store), 3D implementations, animations, balancing and QA fixing.
