Tough Coded is a one-of-a-kind interactive online experience, run LIVE by a Game Master all Fridays 5PM PST.
It works like any twitch stream. The only difference is that you play a game, and the streamer ****s you, live, in real time.

Had the opportunity to work as production coordinator on this project. My main task was to port the original game developed by Fernando Sarmiento, into Unity. Worked on UI, art design, animations, game flow, 3D implementation and marketing materials.
