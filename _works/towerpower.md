Tower Power is a mega-cute, action, super-friendly FLICK'EM up, (which means, a shooter via-flicking), set in the world of BunnyStarLand. Climb up the tower, free and unlock cute friends and defeat the evil birds! It's currently in BETA, and set to be released later this year.

Had the opportunity to work on this project from the start as a production coordinator. Was involved in the early pre-production as well as many different stages of game production (UI, animation, game flow, design, etc). I was also strongly involved AND responsible for all the 3D marketing materials and trailers, as well as branding. The 3D interpretation of the cute 2D designs was a big challenge, but ultimately, with a small team of very talented in-house artists, I believe we nailed it!
