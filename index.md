  <h2 class="content-lead">Hi, I'm <strong>Sebastian</strong>.</h2>
  <p>I'm a <span id="age">26</span> years old Production Coordinator with 3+ years of experience in 3D animation studios and video game companies from Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
  <p>Graduated as Image and Sound Designer from Universidad de Palermo, I moved to Toronto, Ontario, in May 2018 with an open work permit and am currently <strong class="content-highlight">seeking for job opportunities</strong>.</p>
  <p>I'm an ambitious and passionate professional, whoâ€™s fully dedicated to the audiovisual industry, from film to video games and TV series. I have a solid foundation on CGI, having learnt through formal education and by myself. This allows me to interact smoothly from a technical and creative point of view in any production.</p>
