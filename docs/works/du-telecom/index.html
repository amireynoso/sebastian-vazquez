    <p>DU called us to work on an online short that would promote a new campaign aimed at young kids to have the opportunity to play a football game with their favourite stars. Who would ever refuse that? With the help of many very talented artists, we worked on great character designs, and delivered an awesome product.</p>

<p>This was undoubtedly my biggest personal challenge at Peppermelon, as I was responsible for all aspects of production after pre-production. The scale of the project was very big and during 3-4 months we worked very hard on it, having over 30+ characters, twelve scenarios, more than five distinct vehicles, lots of wardrobes and FX, like crowd simulations!</p>
