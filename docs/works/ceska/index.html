    <p>Ceska Bank was one of our biggest clients at the time. With them, we worked on over 13+ fully 3D TV spots, 50+ full sized 3D prints, and many other marketing materials. Without a doubt, it was one of our case studies, as it had a major positive impact for bank’s popularity in Czech Republic.</p>

<p>As a studio, we worked with them for over a whole year. Since the very first drafts for character designs, we wanted to create a family that people could identify themselves with. Personally, I started working with this account from the bottom, and ended up managing budgets, schedules, deliveries, shots, in-house teams as well as outsourcing partners, and ultimately being responsible for most of the projects delivered to them.</p>
